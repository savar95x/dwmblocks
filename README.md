# dwmblocks-async
This is the [dwmblocks-async](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/dwmblocks-async) and not the original dwmblocks. Doe take a look at the original repo for their readme.  

This is meant to be used with [my dwm build](https://github.com/savar95x/dwm) and [my configs](https://github.com/savar95x/dotfiles)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/savar95x/dwmblocks savar95x-dwmblocks/
cd savar95x-dwmblocks/
./compiledwmblocks
```

## Modifying
You can edit the `config.h`.  
I personally have a [dwm/scripts](https://github.com/savar95x/dotfiles/tree/main/scripts/.config/dwm/scripts) directory, which makes it very convinient to manage my modules.  
Refer to the [original readme](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/dwmblocks-async) for more info.
